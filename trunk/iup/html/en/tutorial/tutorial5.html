<h2>5. Object Oriented Simple Paint</h2>
<h3>5.1 <a name="Encapsulation">C++ Encapsulation</a></h3>
<p>As you recall from chapter 4, our Simple Paint source code now has 2500 
lines. It is a lot to process, specially if you are looking for bugs, or 
learning how it works without reading all the previous examples that evolved 
into the final code. So it is time to use some software engineering techniques 
to improve quality and maintenance. We can do that in C too, but modern 
applications are more and more using C++, also because the language provides 
some tools to easy that task. So the first thing we are going to do is to 
convert the code from C to C++. </p>
<p>Actually if you simply save the &quot;simple_paint.c&quot; as &quot;simple_paint.cpp&quot;, and 
use a C++ compiler it will fully work. But it is not what we meant. We would 
like to isolate parts of the code to reduce the interference of one part in 
another. This is called encapsulation in software engeneering. The simplest way 
to do that in C++ is to use classes for major features in the application. So 
looking at our code we can see at least 3 groups of functions: the main dialog, 
the toolbox dialog, and file management.</p>
<p>So we decided to start with 3 classes: <strong>SimplePaint</strong> (the main 
dialog), <strong>SimplePaintToolbox</strong> (the toolkbox dialog) and <strong>
SimplePaintFile</strong> (file management). If you compare the C and the C++ 
codes they are very similar, except that functions are now class methods. Even 
IUP callbacks are now methods, but there is a catch here. Class methods can NOT 
be used as function pointers as the ones used by <strong>IupSetCallback</strong>. 
It order to be able to do that we must implement a static method, use it as the 
callback, and from inside that code call a class method. To do that every time 
for all the callbacks can be very task consuming. So we created a few macros to 
help implementing callbacks as class methods.</p>
<p>These macros are available in the &quot;iup_class_cbs.hpp&quot; include file. To use 
the macros for the callbacks you must call the IUP_CLASS_INITCALLBACK(ih, class) 
macro once, usually in the class constructor after the IUP dialog was created. 
This macro will register the IUP element so the class object can be retrieved 
later transparently for the application. The macros however can be called in any 
order. So we will use the IUP_CLASS_DECLARECALLBACK_*(class, callback) macros to 
declare the callbacks as methods. Since we have several different callbacks 
because of the different parameters, there are several different macros, one for 
each callback signature found in IUP elements. The static method has the same 
name of the callback used in the macro with a &quot;CB_&quot; prefix. So you can also 
directly use its name in <strong>IupSetCallback</strong> if necessary. To 
actually set the callback of an element simply call IUP_CLASS_SETCALLBACK(ih, 
name, callback) just like you call <strong>IupSetCallback</strong>. The callback 
name will be the same you used in IUP_CLASS_DECLARECALLBACK_*(class, callback), 
in fact it will simply call <strong>IupSetCallback</strong> with the static 
callback using the &quot;CB_&quot; prefix. So here is a simple class to illustrate this 
procedure:</p>
<pre>class SampleClass
{
  int sample_count;
  
public:
  SampleClass()
  {
    sample_count = 0;
    
    Ihandle* button = IupButton("Inc", NULL);
    // 2) Associate the callback with the button
    <strong>IUP_CLASS_SETCALLBACK</strong>(button, "ACTION", <span class="auto-style1"><strong>ButtonAction</strong></span>);

    Ihandle* dialog = IupDialog(button);
    // 1) Register this object as a callback receiver (only once)
    <strong>IUP_CLASS_INITCALLBACK</strong>(dialog, SampleClass);

    IupShow(dialog);
  };

protected:
  // 3) Declare the callback as a member function
  <strong>IUP_CLASS_DECLARECALLBACK_IFn</strong>(SampleClass, <span class="auto-style1"><strong>ButtonAction</strong></span>);
};

// 4) Define the callback as a member function
int SampleClass::<span class="auto-style1"><strong>ButtonAction</strong></span>(Ihandle*)
{
  sample_count++;
  return IUP_DEFAULT;
}
</pre>
<p>Using these macros methods of the same C++ class can be set as callbacks for 
any element. For clarity we are going to use a single class to process the 
callbacks of all elements that are children of the same dialog. So we will need 
2 classes for our 2 dialogs. The third class will handle only the image file 
management and it will not have callbacks. To be able to isolate the toolbox 
from the main dialog class we will need some extra methods that will operate 
over the toolbox dialog. Apart from that all the methods of both dialog classes 
are directly equivalent of a function in our C source code. We also tried to 
maintain their position in the source code to simplify the comparison between 
the two.</p>
<p>Notice that only a few methods are left public in both classes, that is where 
the encapsulation occurs. </p>

<h3>5.2 <a name="Modularization">Modularization</a></h3>
<p>In the previous section we purposely left all classes in the same file so you 
will be able to compare it with the C source code. But now is the time to split 
the code in several modules, one for each class. So instead of a 2500 
lines file, we now reduce to 1000 lines for the main file (where the main dialog 
is) and the rest distributed in the other files.</p>

<p>But we actually were able to create a total of 6 modules! 3 modules for the 
classes we already described, and 3 new modules. The 3 modules we already expect 
are: &quot;simple_paint.cpp/h&quot; (<strong>SimplePaint</strong> class), &quot;simple_paint_toolbox.cpp/h&quot; 
(<strong>SimplePaintToolbox</strong>&nbsp; class) and &quot;simple_paint_file.cpp/h&quot; 
(<strong>SimplePaintFile</strong> class). </p>
<p>The first new module is a very simple one, called &quot;simple_paint_main.cpp&quot;. It 
contains only the &quot;<strong>main</strong>&quot; function necessary for the application 
starting point. </p>
<p>The second new module is to store the utility functions that are not related 
to any specific classes. It is called &quot;simple_paint_util.cpp/h&quot;.</p>
<p>And the third module is a new class that we identified mixed up with our
<strong>SimplePaint</strong> class. Inside the main dialog we have a very 
important control that does the most important interface task that is to show 
the image and do the direct interaction defined by the toolbox. As you can guess 
now is the <strong>IupCanvas</strong>. It has several speciall callbacks and as 
we said is the essential tool for our paint interface. So it is a natural 
candidate for separate class we called <strong>SimplePaintCanvas</strong>. It 
will hide the canvas from the main dialog, and encapsulate all its features, 
mainly interaction and zoom control. It is called &quot;simple_paint_canvas.cpp/h&quot;.</p>
<p>Now it is not just easier to find the part of the code we want to fix or 
change, but it is </p>
